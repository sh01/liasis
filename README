This is the python3.0 version of liasis.
It's official status is 'experimental'. The QT client hasn't been ported yet;
other components may be missing a few features relative to the last 2.x
version, but should be mostly functional and stable. They also have some
features that were never part of any python 2.x liasis version.

Bug reports are welcome.
