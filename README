This is the python3.x version of liasis.

If you want to use liasis, this is probably the version you're looking for; the
Python2.x versions have not seen any maintenance for a long time.
Note that while this branch is (as of the time of writing) current, the codebase
is not what you would call 'stable'; liasis is still a WIP, and any given
version might either not work at all, or have bugs that lead to it eating your
hamster.

Bug reports are welcome.
